    This project likely requires a database (e.g., MongoDB). You'll need to set up your database and configure the connection details within your `index.js` or a separate configuration file. Look for database connection related code and update it accordingly.

4.  **Environment Variables (Optional):**
    You might need to set up environment variables for sensitive information like database URIs, session secrets, etc. Create a `.env` file in the project root and define your variables. You'll need to install and configure a package like `dotenv` to load these variables.

5.  **Running the Application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command should start the Node.js server. You can then access the application in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.
